Short answer is nope! It can be done with this version. Next one, this issue will be addressed, that there will be more options to choose from how 
prices will be calculated regarding copies volume. But if you fill adventurous just dive in javascript source code and find k variable commented as 'factor used in moderate price with copies number'.
